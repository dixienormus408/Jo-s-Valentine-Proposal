## About
This is a fun and interactive Valentine's Day proposal page! It includes:

- A playful "Yes" and "No" button where the "No" button moves away when hovered.
- A photo upload option to make it even more personalized.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Read the sweet message. 😊
3. Click the "Yes" button to accept the proposal!
4. If you try clicking "No," well... good luck! 😆
5. Optionally, upload a cute photo of us to make it even more special.
